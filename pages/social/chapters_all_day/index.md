Leaders from OWASP Chapters throughout the world invite you to join us for 24 hours of non-stop AppSec!

We'll kick off the festivities with Welcoming Remarks and a Keynote presentation at 12:00 noon (UTC) on Saturday, 6 June. Then, each hour, the (virtual) floor will be handed over to a leader from another OWASP Chapter, who will introduce speakers from their chapter/region.

At 12:00 noon (UTC) on Sunday, 7 June, we'll wrap things up with a brief recap and closing remarks.

The entire event will be live-streamed on the **[OWASP Chapters All Day](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNkJT42qFOBdnD8pCpelrw)** YouTube Channel.
